# clean_architecture

Template Flutter application with clean architecture structure

## FVM Installation

https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation

- If you're using fvm,run "fvm flutter pub get" instead of "flutter pub get". Add fvm before flutter
  command.

## Getting Started

- Flutter version using : 3.3.10 (stable at 16/12/2022)
- Dart version using : 2.18.6
- DevTools version using : 2.15.0
- Platform android : 33, Build-tools : 32.1.0-rc1
- Java version OpenJDK 11.0.12
- Gradle version 7.2
- Build:gradle 7.1.3
- XCode: 14.2
- CocoaPods version 1.11.3
- Flutter extension version (Android Studio: 69.0.2, VsCode: 3.56.0)

### Configuration Environment Running

- ANDROID STUDIO

Step 1 : Open " Run => Edit Configuration in Android Studio"

Step 2 : Create new Configuration with build flavor value is :

+ Dev Environment : dev
+ Staging Environment : staging
+ Production Environment : production

- VS Code

Step 1 : Open " Run => Open Configuration in VS Code"

Step 2 : Create new Configuration with build flavor value is :

+ Dev Environment : dev
+ Staging Environment : staging
+ Production Environment : production
+ If you want run on release mode, please add "flutterMode": "release" into config object

- Example dev environment:

```
 {
            "name": "dev",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "args": [
                "--flavor",
                "dev"
            ]
        },
```

### Command need to run before run app

- For developer, please
  install [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/node.md) before
  start, it'll help you format code, analyze while commit.
- Please install [flutter plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor) first.
- Please run script "setup_app.sh" in terminal (On MacOS if can't run this script please try "sh
  setup_app.sh")

### Linter

- We're using two linter library, first
  is [flutter_lint](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints/install), second
  is [dart_code_metrics](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_code_metrics) that'll help our code following
  coding convension better.
- Remember to run scripts ".code_analyze.sh" in scripts/.code_analyze.sh folder before push code.

### Build APK

- flutter build apk --flavor {flavorOnStep2}
- Ex: flutter build apk --flavor dev

### Build IPA without archive on Xcode

- flutter build ipa --flavor {flavorOnStep2} --export-options-plist=ios/Runner/ExportOptions.plist
- Ex: flutter build ipa --flavor dev --export-options-plist=ios/Runner/ExportOptions.plist

### Project architecture (Clean Architecture Approach)

1. Why:
    * We want to separate what type of database that we use for storage (might want to change it
      later on)
    * To adhere SOLID principles since we are using OOP for this project.
    * Ensuring UI layers don't know what is going on at data layer at all.
    * Might want to separate each layers into different packages.
2. Presentation - Domain - Data.
3. Presentation layer consist of
    * Widgets
    * BLoC
        * Bloc only manages UI state based on business logic
4. Domain layer (Business logic layer)
    * Repositories (interfaces aka idea how the logic would behave)
    * Entities (or models which what UI needs)
    * Usecases (user stories)
        * Typically one function, but can be more if they are functionality related.
        * Remember, one class for one responsibility.
5. Data layer
    * Data Sources
        * remotes (API)
        * locals (Database)
    * Models
        * request
        * response
    * Repositories (Implementation from Domain layer)
6. More insight of layers

7. The inner layer should **NOT** know what the outer layer has / do.

### Configure Firebase Multi Flavor

Step 1 : Install Firebase CLI with npm : "npm install -g firebase-tools"

https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-mac-linux

Step 2 : Login to firebase account : "firebase login"

Step 3 : Install FlutterFire CLI with this command : "dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli"

Step 4 : Configure multi flavor with:

Run command "flutterfire configure -i packageName -a packageName -o lib/firebase/firebase_options_
{flavor}.dart" for each flavor.

Dev: "flutterfire configure -i com.vmo.c3FlutterTemp.dev -a com.vmo.c3FlutterTemp.dev -o
lib/firebase/firebase_options_dev.dart"

Staging: "flutterfire configure -i com.vmo.c3FlutterTemp.staging -a com.vmo.c3FlutterTemp.staging -o
lib/firebase/firebase_options_staging.dart"

Production: "flutterfire configure -i com.vmo.c3FlutterTemp -a com.vmo.c3FlutterTemp -o
lib/firebase/firebase_options.dart"

Other configure:

Documentation at : https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios

### Injections

1. We are using [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) for injections. It is fun because we can
   start the service locator and use it everywhere when needed because they are injected at
   top-level in main.dart.
2. Only use it upon initialization

```
getIt.registerSingleton<LoginBloc>(LoginBloc(
    loginUseCase: LoginUseCase(getIt<LoginRepositoryImpl>()),
  ));
```

and use it on `route`

```
BlocProvider<LoginBloc>(
    create: (_) => getIt.get<LoginBloc>(),
),
```

for reusing the `BLoC`,

```
BlocProvider.value(
    value: getIt.get<PumpsBloc>(),
)
```

for usage (in Widgets), **always** use

`context.read<PumpsBloc>().add(AddPumps());`

instead of

`getIt.get<PumpsBloc>().add(AppPumps());`

For non widget usage, manually inject the object on initialization.

### Localization

We are using [Easy Localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) to handle
multi-languages.
Using [Google Sheet Generator](https://github.com/Hoang-Nguyenn/easy_localization_generator) on
cloud will take less effort for change and update key and value. Only need update in google sheet
file.

Google sheet sample on this project :
"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SpiJWFRfJaIRnzpEc0mJ2WaaI9JYlz8jKBPduAPzdXE/edit#gid=1013756643"

Step to set-up google sheet :

- 1 : Create a CSV Google Sheet with form like that form
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SpiJWFRfJaIRnzpEc0mJ2WaaI9JYlz8jKBPduAPzdXE/edit#gid=1013756643"
- 2 : Enable share for anyone have this link
- 3 : on file locale_keys.dart in lib/utils/multi-languages/locale_keys.dart change docId annotation
  with your google sheet docid Example of DocID is :
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SpiJWFRfJaIRnzpEc0mJ2WaaI9JYlz8jKBPduAPzdXE (it's docId)
  /edit#gid=1013756643"
- 4 : run terminal : "flutter pub run build_runner build" to generate .g.dart localization file
- 5 : When update new value on google sheet should update plus one version on SheetLocalization at
  locale_keys.dart and run "flutter packages pub run build_runner build" again to get new file csv

Step to use multi-languages import in code:

- Remember import file "multi_languages_utils.dart" instead of "locale_keys.dart" because first file
  already import library easy_localization extension,you no need to use 2 import

- Using : LocaleKeys.keyDefine.tr()  (tr() is using to change languages with current languages
  setup, remember have it)

Link library : https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization
Link plugin generate csv from google
sheet : https://github.com/Hoang-Nguyenn/easy_localization_generator

### Json parsing / serialization

This project is implementing [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable). It use
build_runner to generate files. If you make a change to these files, you need to re-run the
generator using build_runner:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

generator using build_runner and remove conflict file :

```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Dio Interceptor

- This project using [pretty_dio_logger](https://pub.dev/packages/pretty_dio_logger) for display log
  in console and [alice](https://pub.dev/packages/alice) inspector http request in UI for debugging.

## Assets

- Image is handled by [flutter_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen) for auto-complete and not
  have to deal with typing mistakes.
- To setup flutter_gen, run `dart pub global activate flutter_gen`

### Adding new Assets

- Add asset(s) into `assets/<asset types>`
- Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` in console
- New image(s) will appear in `lib/gen/assets`

### Remove Asset(s)

- Delete assets from `assets/<asset types>`
- Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` in console
- `lib/gen/assets` will be updated with currently available assets.

### How to change version number and version code :

- Go to pubspec.yaml => line version to change :
- Example : 1.0.10+3 => Version name : 1.0.10, Version code : 3

### Step to change package name

- We using library [change_app_package_name](https://pub.dev/packages/change_app_package_name) for
  easy and fast to change all package name on android and IOS
- Using terminal : flutter pub run change_app_package_name:main "newPackageName"
- Example : flutter pub run change_app_package_name:main com.domain.newApp

## Using fastlane

- Require JAVAHOME (JDK 11 https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11-mac)
- Install Ruby (https://docs.fastlane.tools/)
- run script scripts/.setup_fastlane.sh (First time run)
- bundle exec fastlane android buildAndroidLocal --env dev (Dev environment)
- bundle exec fastlane android distribute --env dev (Dev environment Distribute)
- bundle exec fastlane ios buildIOS --env dev (Dev environment)
- bundle exec fastlane ios getProvision --env dev (Get provision dev environment)

## Script that help generate clean architecture feature

- WHY:
- Because clean architecture have too much folder and file need to create for one feature
- Take developer more useless time for create these file and folder

- WHAT:
- Write a script that will automatically create template folder and template file for clean
  architecture
- Run script: "sh gen_clean.sh feature_name"
  Example: "sh gen_clean.sh signin"
- This script will create:

```
|   |--data                                          # data layer for clean architecture 
|   |   |--generate_feature                          # generate_feature folder
|   |   |   |--api                                   # api folder
|   |   |   |   |--generate_feature_api.dart         # generate_feature abstract class for retrofit
|   |   |   |--models                                # models folder for data layer
|   |   |   |   |--request                           # request model folder
|   |   |   |   |--response                          # response model folder
|   |   |   |--repositories                          # repositories folder for data layer
|   |   |   |   |--generate_feature_repository_impl  # generate_feature repository impl file
|   |--domain                                        # domain layer for clean architecture 
|   |   |--generate_feature                          # generate_feature domain folder
|   |   |   |--entities                              # entities folder
|   |   |   |--repositories                          # generate_feature domain repositories folder
|   |   |   |   |--generate_feature_repository.dart  # generate_feature repository abstract file
|   |   |   |--usecases                              # generate_feature usecases folder
|   |   |   |   |--generate_feature_usecase.dart     # generate_feature usecase file

```
